# Fatal-Force  
The modeling of fatal shootings by on-duty police officers  

**A STOR 664 & 665: Applied I & II (first year Ph.D. applied core course series) project(s) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**  
Intended to explore the usefullness of the generalized elastic net

Main data: The police shootings database (2015 to present) maintained by the Washington Post  
FBI data: crime statistics and police employment by officer type  
Census data: state population by demographics from the 2010 census  

Main limitations
  1. Only additive models considered
  2. Most recent census nearly 10 years prior to most recent shooting data

Suggested extensions
  1. Use of the relaxed lasso
  2. Model with focus on inference as opposed to prediction
